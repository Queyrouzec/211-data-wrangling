This project will help cleanup data for [Via Link](https://vialink.org/), the non-profit that runs the 211 system and call centers for the New Orleans-based region of Louisiana. 

## Initial setup

### prerequisites

You must have Python 3 installed.  You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

> If you are using Windows, be sure to select the "Add Python to PATH" option 

You can confirm it is installed correctly by running `python3 --version` in a terminal or command prompt.  

### install the dependencies

In python, dependencies are often installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files)

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running the scripts

TBD - but probably something like this:

```
python cleanup /path/to/file1.xlsx /path/to/file2.xlsx
```
